### Description

Update 07Feb, 13:46 UTC. A complete TLB TypeLibrary for GDI+ version 1.0.5 Includes all known functions, constants, enums, and structures(UDTs). Note changes in RectL/RectF - Right/Bottom are Width/Height as per Platform SDK. ALso see demo to see how strings are passed. Demo is a clone of PSC LogoMan except all the graphics are done in newer GDI+. A good example of how to use path, brush, pen, texture, hatch and gradients in GDI+. If you don't have XP or Win2k SP3 then you must install GDI+(free from Microsoft) at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32738. Requires Forms Object 2.0 which is part of Office. If you don't have Office you can download FM20.Dll as part of SetupPad.Exe at http://download.microsoft.com/download/activexcontrolpad/Install/4.0.0.950/WIN98MeXP/EN-

To see Unicode Far East glyphs in 2K/Xp you may need to go to Control Panel, Regional Configurations, Languages, and check the box for Far east support. In 98/ME you must have a Unicode font installed such as Arial Unicode MS.

Please report any errors that work with a local GDI+ Declare but not from this TLB.
